## Good to meet you! I'm Trevik ðŸ‘‹  
### Software Engineer, and life-long creator    
  
I am glad that you found me and hope you find what you are looking for. I grew up in a small town in Southern Idaho and I started working young building mechanical bulls. All of my life I have been creating things. From bulls, fully automatic paintball guns, houses, to websites.
